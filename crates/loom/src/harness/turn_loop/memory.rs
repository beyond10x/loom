//! Memories: `recall`, a vault the caller hands in, never one the loop goes and finds.
//!
//! # Why this repository had no memory until now, and what makes one admissible
//!
//! An ambient memory file is a hermeticity hazard, and `metaharness` rejects one by rule: the
//! scratch root it copies a tree into has no `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` ancestor above it, so a
//! run cannot be steered by a document nobody declared. That rejection is right and this module
//! does not weaken it. What is admitted here is not discovery — it is the **same shape as
//! [`crate::harness::turn_loop::Skills`]**: a caller-owned value, constructed outside the loop from
//! a path an operator typed, cloned into delegates, and never re-read. The loop walks no directory
//! and reads no file, before the run or during it. A memory this run did not start with is a memory
//! it cannot get.
//!
//! # `trust` has exactly one legal value, and that is the point
//!
//! A vault memory is **unreviewed context**. It is what some earlier run believed, written down by
//! a writer nobody reviewed, and the model reads it as prose. Governed truth is not made by
//! marking a record trusted: it is **promoted out** of the vault into a canonical artifact — a
//! planning artifact, an ADR, a contract directory — which has its own review and its own
//! immutability. So [`MemoryTrust`] is an enum whose only variant is
//! [`MemoryTrust::Unreviewed`], and a record claiming anything else is refused by name rather
//! than downgraded. A field that can only hold one value looks redundant until somebody tries to
//! write the second one; the refusal is the whole feature, and a `bool` or a free string would
//! have accepted it silently.
//!
//! # Nothing is deleted, and nothing is edited
//!
//! [`MemoryStatus`] flips — `active`, then `rejected` or `superseded` — and the record stays.
//! A correction is a **new** record naming the one it replaces in [`Memory::supersedes`], so the
//! old text and the reason it stopped being true both survive. There is no update path in this
//! type and no writer in this repository at all (see the module's absence of one, and
//! Harness `AGENTS.md`'s read-only toolset rule at `798325f0`): admitting a memory to be *read* is
//! this change, and admitting one to be *written* is a different change with its own gate.
//!
//! # Empty is never how a partial read reports itself
//!
//! [`Memories::new`] refuses the whole set when one record is bad, by name, and never returns a
//! smaller one. A caller whose construction was truncated must not be handed a vault that reads
//! exactly like a complete vault with fewer memories in it — that is invariant 8 of Harness
//! `AGENTS.md` at `798325f0`'s *a truncated tool result reads to the model exactly like a complete
//! one*, one layer up, and invariant 7's *preserve absence as absence*. The refusal says which
//! record and which field.
//!
//! # Bidi overrides and control codepoints are refused in every field a human reads
//!
//! A record is read twice — by this parser, and by a person auditing the vault — and a
//! Trojan-Source reordering makes those two readings disagree. U+202A–U+202E and U+2066–U+2069
//! reorder a line in a terminal without changing a byte the parser sees, so a summary that renders
//! as *"do not delete the production database"* can parse as the opposite. C0 and C1 controls do
//! the same job more crudely. They are refused in every field, and single-line fields also refuse
//! the newline and tab that the body is allowed: a summary carrying a newline forges an extra
//! bullet in [`Memories::brief`], which is a fabricated memory in the standing instruction.
//!
//! # The descriptions-in-the-instruction split is kept, for a second reason
//!
//! It is kept for [`crate::harness::turn_loop::Skills`]'s reason — a stateless loop replays its
//! whole conversation, so a body in the standing instruction is billed on every turn of every run,
//! including the runs that never wanted it. It is kept for one more reason here: a vault grows
//! without bound while a skill library is curated, so the per-turn cost of eager bodies rises with
//! every run the operator ever made, which is precisely the cost curve that would make memory
//! unaffordable. The summaries are the index and the bodies are behind one enumerated call.
