//! What a run cost, at rates somebody declared.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! Until now this loop reported tokens and no price, on the reasoning that *a gateway relays bytes
//! and reports no price*. That reasoning was half right and the wrong half mattered: the provider
//! does not return a price, but a price still exists, and every other harness in the comparison
//! states one. Claude Code prices a run it served on a **subscription** — the figure comes from a
//! model catalogue it fetches, not from the response — and reports `total_cost_usd` all the same.
//! A record that answered "tokens: 4,700" beside one that answered "$0.11" could not be compared on
//! the axis an evaluation programme cares about most.
//!
//! # Declared, never guessed
//!
//! Rates are not compiled in. A table baked into this binary would be a set of numbers nobody could
//! date, wrong the first time a rate moved, and wrong silently. Instead the operator points the run
//! at a **rate card** — a small JSON document that names its own source and the day it was read —
//! and every figure the run reports can be traced back to it.
//!
//! ```json
//! {
//!   "source": "openai.com/api/pricing, read by hand",
//!   "as_of": "2026-08-24",
//!   "models": {
//!     "gpt-5.6-sol": {
//!       "input_usd_per_mtok": 1.25,
//!       "cached_input_usd_per_mtok": 0.125,
//!       "output_usd_per_mtok": 10.0
//!     }
//!   }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! No card means no price, and **no price is reported as absent rather than as zero**. A model the
//! card does not list is warned about by name, once, at the start of the run — so a reader who sees
//! no cost knows nobody supplied a rate, rather than concluding the run was free.
//!
//! # Millionths of a dollar, and why the parts sum to the whole
//!
//! Every figure here is an integer count of micro-US-dollars. Arithmetic happens in
//! **pico**-dollars per token so that no rate has to be rounded before it is multiplied, and each
//! turn is rounded to a micro-dollar exactly once. The run total is the sum of the rounded turns
//! rather than a separately rounded total, which is what makes a reader's addition of the per-turn
//! figures agree with the total printed beside them.
