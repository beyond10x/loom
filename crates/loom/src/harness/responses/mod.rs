//! `OpenAI` Responses wire adapter for the b10x agent loop.
//!
//! It speaks one documented endpoint, `POST {base}/responses`, in streaming mode, and projects it
//! into [`crate::harness::wire`]'s neutral values. It holds no credential: the bearer is read from
//! an injected source at call time and dropped when the call ends.
//!
//! # What is here and what is beneath
//!
//! Everything in this crate names an `OpenAI` field, header or event: the request projection, the
//! stream decoder, the three headers that identify the conversation, and the endpoint's path.
//! Everything *between* the HTTP client and that projection — bounded server-sent-event framing,
//! the retry rule, the back-off, the witnessed sink that makes the retry rule safe and the status
//! mapping — is [`crate::harness::http`], which this crate configures with [`TRANSPORT`] and
//! nothing else. It lived here until the second wire copied all of it unchanged, which is what
//! proved it was transport-shaped rather than vendor-shaped.
//!
//! Ported from Harness `harness-responses` at `798325f0`: the Responses projection and its stream
//! decoder.
