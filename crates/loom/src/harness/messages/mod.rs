//! Anthropic Messages wire adapter for the b10x agent loop.
//!
//! It speaks one documented endpoint, `POST {base}/messages`, in streaming mode, and projects it
//! into [`crate::harness::wire`]'s neutral values. It holds no credential: the bearer is read from
//! an injected source at call time and dropped when the call ends.
//!
//! # What the second wire cost, and where
//!
//! The projection is in `project` and is entirely this wire's own: role-alternating messages
//! instead of a flat input array, content blocks instead of output items, an argument object
//! instead of encoded argument text, disjoint token counts instead of nested ones, and a required
//! output bound where the first wire had an optional one. The credential's *presentation* is this
//! wire's too — two header names for one secret, depending on which route issued it.
//!
//! What is **not** this wire's own is everything between the HTTP client and that projection:
//! bounded server-sent-event framing, the retry rule, the back-off, the witnessed sink that makes
//! the retry rule safe, and the status-code mapping. None of it is vendor-shaped — it is
//! *transport*-shaped — and this wire proved it by needing all of it unchanged. It was a near-copy
//! of `harness-responses` for exactly one release, which is the evidence that argued for
//! [`crate::harness::http`]; it now lives there, and this crate configures it with [`TRANSPORT`].
//!
//! One thing in that shared half is genuinely per-wire and is named rather than unified: this
//! route has **no `[DONE]` sentinel**. Its terminal marker is a `message_stop` *payload*, so
//! end-of-stream is the decoder's decision and not the framer's, and a `[DONE]` line here is a
//! payload that is not JSON — a protocol refusal, which is what it must stay.
//!
//! Ported from Harness `harness-messages` at `798325f0`: the Messages projection and its stream
//! decoder.
