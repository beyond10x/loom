//! Bounded server-sent-event reading.
//!
//! The stream is untrusted input from a network peer, so every read is bounded twice: one event
//! cannot grow without limit, and neither can the stream as a whole. Without the second bound a
//! peer that never closes holds the loop forever while the process grows.
//!
//! # Where this came from
//!
//! the first wire, and byte-for-byte from the second, which copied it when that
//! wire was built. Framing is not vendor-shaped: `data:`, comments, the blank-line terminator and
//! the two bounds are the same on both routes, and neither reader ever looked inside a payload.
//!
//! # The one thing the two routes do not agree on
//!
//! Whether `data: [DONE]` ends the stream. On the first route it is the terminal frame; on the
//! second there is no sentinel at all — the terminal marker is a *payload* (`message_stop`), and a
//! `[DONE]` line arriving there is a payload that is not JSON, which is a protocol refusal and
//! must stay one. Unifying the two would have silently taught the second route a sentinel it does
//! not speak, so the difference is carried as [`Framing`] and each wire names its own.
