/// Maps a status the far side answered with onto a typed refusal, and says whether to try again.
///
/// `wire` is the caller's own name for itself, so the message says who was answered — the only
/// vendor-shaped thing in this mapping, and it arrives as an argument rather than living here.
///
/// # Where this came from
///
/// the first wire, copied unchanged into the second. Both arrived at the same table
/// independently of any field name, which is what makes it transport-shaped: it reads the status
/// line and nothing else.
///
/// # The table, and the two entries that are arguments rather than lookups
///
/// Every status in the retriable set says *the far side never got to answer*. 503 is a gateway
/// still starting a backend, and 529 — one route's own *overloaded* status — lands with the rest
/// of the 5xx range for the same reason. 408 is a far side that gave up waiting for a request it
/// never finished reading, so no model saw it and nothing was produced from it; sending it again
/// is the entire remedy.
///
/// 409 is deliberately **not** there: a conflict is a disagreement about state, and the identical
/// request conflicts identically a second later, so a retry would spend the run's budget to be
/// refused four times.
