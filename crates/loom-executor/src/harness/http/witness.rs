//! The sink that decides what may be retried.

use crate::harness::wire::{StreamEvent, StreamSink};

/// A sink that remembers whether anything reached the caller.
///
/// **The whole of the retry rule.** Resending a request is safe on the routes this repository
/// speaks: turns are stateless (invariant 4 of Harness `AGENTS.md` at `798325f0`), nothing is
/// retained on the far side, and a second identical `POST` is a fresh turn. What is *not* safe is
/// resending after the caller has already seen part of the first attempt: the text deltas are out,
/// a person has read them, and a second attempt would append a second copy of the same sentence to
/// the record. So an attempt that has emitted **anything** is final, whatever went wrong.
///
/// In practice that keeps exactly the failures worth retrying **here**: a refused connection, a
/// rate limit, a gateway still starting a backend — all of which land before the first byte of the
/// stream.
///
/// # The loop retries what this sink will not
///
/// A turn whose stream broke after the first delta is still worth another attempt: losing a
/// twenty-turn run to one dropped connection is the most expensive way a run can fail. That
/// attempt cannot be made *here*, because the caller has already been handed half a sentence and
/// appending a second copy of it is not a retry but a corrupted transcript. So the two decisions
/// are taken in two places: the transport never resends after emitting and reports
/// [`crate::harness::wire::WireError::retriable`] honestly, and the loop above it — which owns the
/// transcript and can therefore throw the partial turn away — decides whether to ask for the turn
/// again. Widening `retriable` is consequently a change the loop acts on, not a change to what
/// this sink does.
///
/// # Where this came from
///
/// the first wire, copied unchanged into the second. Nothing in it is route-shaped:
/// it counts emissions, which the neutral [`StreamSink`] already defines.
