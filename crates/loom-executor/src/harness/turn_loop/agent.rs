//! Named agents: a delegate the operator described in advance, on a **narrower** gate.
//!
//! `delegate` beside this hands a fresh context the parent's whole catalogue and a task written on
//! the spot. A named agent is the other half: a standing description the operator wrote before the
//! run — what this agent is for, what it may touch, and the instruction it works under — that the
//! model picks by name. The value of naming one is that the model chooses between *reviewer* and
//! *researcher* on a line it can read every turn, instead of the run's author re-explaining the
//! same sub-task in every task string.
//!
//! # An agent narrows; it can never widen
//!
//! [`crate::harness::turn_loop::Delegation`]'s doc states the property this file must not break:
//! *"Delegation widens nothing: the child can do exactly what the parent's catalogue admits, entry
//! for entry."* [`Agent::admitted`] therefore returns an **intersection** with the parent's list,
//! never a union, and no other function here hands out a tool name at all.
//!
//! That is not defensive tidiness — it is the difference between a document and a grant. An agent
//! file is markdown, and markdown arrives from places nobody audits: a plugin directory, a
//! checked-out dependency, a repository a colleague opened. If `tools: [run]` in frontmatter could
//! *add* `run`, then writing a file into a workspace would be enough to execute commands on the
//! operator's machine — on a run whose catalogue deliberately did not publish `run`, and past the
//! approval gate, because the gate is only ever asked about entries that exist. So a declared name
//! the parent does not have buys exactly nothing, and the test that proves it is the hostile one.
//!
//! # An agent that declares no tools is unrestricted, not disarmed
//!
//! The on-disk format's `tools:` key is optional, and a file without one has declared **no
//! restriction** — it has not declared *no tools*. Reading the absent key as an empty allowance
//! would silently disarm every agent file written without one, and the failure is quiet: the agent
//! runs, does nothing, and reports that it could not find anything. That is invariant 7 of Harness
//! `AGENTS.md` at `798325f0`, *preserve absence as absence*, applied to a field rather than to
//! usage. Empty [`Agent::tools`] therefore means the parent's whole catalogue, and the caller that
//! read the file is the one that must not invent an empty list where the document was silent.
//!
//! # What the agent asked for and did not get is written down
//!
//! A name the parent lacks is refused, but it is refused **out loud**, as a [`Withheld`] entry
//! carrying the tool and a sentence saying why. Dropping it silently would leave a reader unable
//! to tell *this agent never wanted `run`* from *this agent asked for `run` and this machine would
//! not admit it* — the same distinction `Started::withheld` exists to keep, and the more useful
//! one of the two, because it is the one that explains why an agent underperformed its
//! description.
//!
//! # This crate parses nothing, and knows no vendor's tool names
//!
//! [`Agents`] is a loaded value, exactly as [`crate::harness::turn_loop::Skills`] is. Walking
//! `agents/*.md`, reading YAML frontmatter, and mapping the vendor's verbs — `Read`, `Grep`,
//! `Glob`, `Bash` — onto this harness's catalogue entries are all `harness-cli`'s work. By the time
//! an [`Agent`] exists here its `tools` are **already harness-native names**, comparable to the
//! parent's list by string equality; if they were not, an intersection would silently admit nothing
//! and this file's whole guarantee would degrade into an unexplained empty catalogue.
//!
//! Design: Harness docs/design/0002-sub-agents-structured-output-hooks.md at `798325f0`, § 2.
