//! What a delegate running on its own thread may ask the run it belongs to.
//!
//! # One approver, one hook file, one event stream — however many children
//!
//! A group of delegates runs side by side, but three of the things a child needs are not
//! duplicable and must not be duplicated. A person answering an approval is one person, and two
//! prompts written to one terminal at once are a prompt nobody can answer. An operator's hook is a
//! program they wrote expecting to be asked about one call at a time. And the run's
//! [`LoopSink`](crate::harness::turn_loop::LoopSink) is the record: a single ordered stream a
//! renderer indents and a JSONL reader parses.
//!
//! So a child thread owns its model port and its tool port — genuinely forked, genuinely parallel
//! — and **borrows nothing else**. Everything else it needs, it asks the parent thread for over a
//! channel, and the parent answers them one at a time in the order they arrive. The parent is
//! sitting in a receive loop for exactly as long as any child is running, so there is no moment at
//! which a question goes unanswered.
//!
//! # Every proxy fails closed
//!
//! Each of these blocks on an answer from the parent. If the parent is gone — the run was torn
//! down, the channel hung up — the answer is the refusing one: an approval nobody gave is a
//! denial, and a hook that could not be consulted did not say yes (Harness design 0002 at
//! `798325f0`, § 3). A proxy that defaulted to *proceed* on a dead channel would be a way to run a
//! call past the gate by arranging for the gate to be unreachable.
//!
//! Design: Harness docs/design/0002-sub-agents-structured-output-hooks.md at `798325f0`, § 2,
//! milestone M4.
