#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! The b10x agent loop.
//!
//! One turn goes out, tool calls come back, the results go in and the next turn goes out. Owning
//! that cycle is the whole point: the tools are ours to publish, the budgets are ours to count,
//! and an approval is a blocking call rather than a protocol round trip that can land after the
//! effect.
//!
//! The loop reaches a model through [`crate::harness::wire::ModelPort`] and its tools through
//! [`crate::harness::wire::ToolPort`]. In-process those tools are direct calls; under a bridge they
//! are a callback over the wire. The loop cannot tell the difference, which is what keeps the
//! embedded and the bridged harness the same code.
//!
//! # Hooks narrow a run; they never widen it
//!
//! An operator may attach their own programs at three moments — before a call, after one, and at
//! the stop ([`HookPort`], Harness design 0002 at `798325f0`, § 3). Every one of them can only
//! **narrow**. `before-call` is consulted after the approver has already said yes, so a call a
//! person refused never reaches a hook and a hook cannot un-refuse it; its only answers are
//! *proceed* and *no*, and a hook that could not decide is a *no* (fail closed — a hook that could
//! not run did not say yes). `after-call` may leave the model a note beside a result and cannot
//! mark the result failed. `stop` may take away the model's right to stop, at most
//! [`MAX_STOP_HOOK_CONTINUES`] times, and cannot add a right to act. A hook that widened would be a
//! second gate nobody reviews.
//!
//! All three fire for the loop's own tools as well ([`OutputSchema`], [`Delegation`]), with each
//! tool's own spec as the entry — a `before-call` declaration with no tool filter means *every*
//! call. The one place a point does **not** fire is the end of a delegate: `stop` is about the
//! run's ending, and a child's ending is not one (see `AgentLoop::stop_hook`).
//!
//! **The loop spawns no process.** [`HookPort`] is a seam exactly as [`ApprovalPort`] is; the
//! implementation that runs a process — the argv, the timeout, the stdout bound, the file naming
//! the hooks — lives in the shell, which read that file from a path the operator gave it. Nothing
//! here discovers a hook from a workspace. A run with hooks attached also batches nothing, so a
//! hook fires exactly once per call.
//!
//! It does start **threads**, in one place: a turn's `delegate` calls may run side by side
//! (`AgentLoop::delegates_side_by_side`). That is not a hole in the sentence above — a hook is
//! still asked once per call, still by the shell's own [`HookPort`], and still on this thread. A
//! child on a worker thread reaches the approver, the hooks and the record by asking this one
//! (`parallel`), so there is exactly one of each however many children there are.

//! # The two tools the loop owns
//!
//! [`OutputSchema`] publishes `answer` and [`Delegation`] publishes `delegate`, and neither is a
//! catalogue entry: `answer` performs no operation on any machine, and `delegate` performs
//! whatever this run's own tools perform, through this run's own gate. So they belong here rather
//! than to a [`crate::harness::wire::ToolPort`], which never sees them — their specs are appended
//! after the port's on every turn, a call naming one is resolved before anything else and is never
//! batched, never routed by bare name and never handed to the port, and a port that already
//! publishes a name they need refuses the run ([`LoopError::Config`]) before the first byte goes
//! out. Each still produces exactly one [`Item::ToolResult`], because a call replayed without its
//! result is a hard error on the next turn.
//!
//! Both are opt-in per run ([`LoopConfig::output_schema`], [`LoopConfig::delegation`], both
//! [`None`] by default), so every invocation written before they existed means what it did.
//! Design: Harness docs/design/0002-sub-agents-structured-output-hooks.md at `798325f0`, § 0.
//!
//! Ported from Harness `harness-loop` at `798325f0`: turn assembly, tool round trips, approvals,
//! budgets and cancellation.
