//! Skills: `skill`, the operator's instructions loaded when the model wants them.
//!
//! # Why the body is not simply prepended
//!
//! A run given a skill up front pays for it on **every** turn: this loop is stateless and replays
//! the whole conversation, so a 6 KB `SKILL.md` is 6 KB of input on turn one and on turn forty,
//! whether or not the run ever needed it. `--context` exists for the files a run genuinely needs
//! throughout, and its doc says so; a library of skills is the other case.
//!
//! So the **descriptions** go in the standing instruction — one line each, identical every turn,
//! in the half of the request a prompt cache holds — and the **body** arrives as a tool result when
//! the model asks for it. That is what the vendor whose format this reads does, and it is why the
//! two arms of a comparison can be read against each other at all: a native run that was handed
//! every body eagerly and a vendor run that loaded one on demand are not the same experiment.
//!
//! # This crate parses nothing
//!
//! [`Skills`] is a loaded value. Walking directories and reading `SKILL.md` frontmatter is
//! `harness-cli`'s, exactly as `hooks.rs` there loads what `hook.rs` here defines. A loop that went
//! and looked at a filesystem would be a loop whose behaviour depends on something no caller
//! declared.
//!
//! # The format is a vendor's, and that is stated rather than hidden
//!
//! `SKILL.md` with `name`/`description` frontmatter is Anthropic's on-disk shape. Reading a
//! vendor's **file format** is not the same act as becoming a client of a vendor **protocol**.
//! Nothing here speaks to a server, opens a socket, or grants the remote authority; outbound MCP
//! does those things only through a separately reviewed profile at the shell boundary.
