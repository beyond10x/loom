//! Hooks: the operator's own programs, consulted at three moments of a run.
//!
//! # A hook can only narrow
//!
//! `before-call` fires **after** the approver said yes, and its block is one more refusal. It
//! cannot approve, cannot change the call, and cannot reach a tool the run did not publish. A hook
//! that widened would be a second gate nobody reviews (invariant 12 of Harness `AGENTS.md` at
//! `798325f0`). `stop` can keep a run working — that is narrowing too: it takes away the model's
//! right to stop, never adds a right to act.
//!
//! # The loop spawns no process, and runs no hook on a thread of its own
//!
//! This is a port, exactly as [`crate::harness::turn_loop::ApprovalPort`] is. The implementation
//! that runs a process lives in the shell, where the file naming the hooks was read from a path the
//! operator gave. Nothing here is ever discovered from the workspace: a hook found in a repository
//! would be a program the *repository* runs on the operator's machine.
//!
//! A run whose delegates go side by side is the one place the loop starts threads, and the
//! operator's programs stay off them: a child asks the run's thread, which holds the one
//! [`HookPort`] the shell attached and consults it for one call at a time
//! ([`crate::harness::turn_loop::parallel`]). *How many copies of my guard are running* must not
//! depend on how many sub-tasks a model happened to ask for.
//!
