//! Sub-agents: `delegate`, a fresh context on the same gate.
//!
//! A delegate is a second [`crate::harness::turn_loop::AgentLoop`] run to completion **inside** the
//! first one's tool call, over a conversation that starts empty, returning its final text as the
//! tool result. It shares the parent's model port, tool port, approver, hooks, cancellation token
//! and the remainder of the parent's budget; it has its own turn ceiling and no `delegate` of its
//! own. Delegation widens nothing: the child can do exactly what the parent's catalogue admits,
//! entry for entry, and every call inside it meets the same gate.
//!
//! Design: Harness docs/design/0002-sub-agents-structured-output-hooks.md at `798325f0`, § 2.

    your own tools can find out. There is nobody to ask — no question you write reaches a person, \
    and asking one only spends a turn — so where something is underspecified, decide, act, and say \
    in your report what you decided and why. You report exactly once, in the text of your final \
    message: that message is the whole of what the agent that sent you reads, and everything else \
    — what you read, what you tried, your reasoning — is discarded with your context. Write it \
    for somebody who saw none of that. Keep it short, a few hundred words at most: it travels back \
    as a single tool result, and one over this harness's result bound is refused by name and the \
