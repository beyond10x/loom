//! What a tool declares about itself, and what one call actually touches.
//!
//! # Why a tool declares anything at all
//!
//! The published toolset is this harness's entire safety boundary — `README.md` says so: *"this
//! harness's effects are exactly what its toolset admits and nothing constrains it further."* While
//! every tool was read-only that boundary needed no vocabulary: nothing could go wrong. A `write`
//! and a `run` change that, and something has to be able to answer *may this call happen* without
//! reading the tool's source.
//!
//! The vocabulary is `flux-spec`'s, taken rather than invented, because it has been through the
//! argument once and the terms already mean something to everyone who works on these components.
//!
//! # A spec is a claim; the subjects are the fact
//!
//! [`ToolSpec`](crate::harness::wire::ToolSpec) says what a tool *can* do.
//! [`ToolPort::subjects`](crate::harness::wire::ToolPort) says what *this call* does. They are
//! checked separately and the second is the one that stops things: a tool that honestly declares
//! [`Effect::Write`] and is handed a path outside the workspace is refused on the **subject**,
//! because the declaration was right and the call was not.
//!
//! Without that split, declaration is a promise nobody checks — worse than no declaration, because
//! it reads like a boundary.
//!
//! # The vocabulary invariant, taken unchanged
//!
//! From `flux-spec` (C-184): **a variant names a consequence class — what could go wrong, who sees
//! it, whether it can be undone — never an application domain.** *Runs the test suite*, *creates a
//! planning artifact* and *opens a pull request* are [`Effect::Process`], [`Effect::Write`] and
//! [`Effect::Network`] consequences of particular domains. Giving each domain a variant grows an
//! unbounded catalog on a wire enum, and flux already carries one deprecated variant that proves
//! the point.
